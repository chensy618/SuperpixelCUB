# Prepare models for VLPart

VLPart uses two backbones including ResNet-50 and Swin-Base. The pretrained ResNet-50 model can be downloaded automatically by timm. 
We also provide pretrained [Swin-Base](https://github.com/PeizeSun/VLPart/releases/download/v0.1/swin_base_patch4_window7_224_22k.pkl) which are compatible with Detectron2. Please download them to VLPart_ROOT/models/ before training:


The trained models are in the [Model Zoo](../MODEL_ZOO.md).
